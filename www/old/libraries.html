<p>The mass spectral library packages are available through the R
install commands described below, or through
the <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=417">R-Forge
webpage</a>.

<p>Mass spectral libraries are provided as companion packages to
OrgMassSpecR. The library content is currently focused on electron
impact (EI) spectra of anthropogenic environmental contaminants and
halogenated natural products. The libraries are intended to document
and organize the evidence for compound identifications, and thus have
a somewhat different focus than standard reference databases such as
the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist1a.cfm">NIST/EPA/NIH
library</a>. For example, the OrgMassSpecR libraries store fragment
ion identifications obtained by the manual interpretation of mass
spectra and allow organization based on compound class and other
parameters. The libraries may also contain interesting but
unidentified mass spectra.

<p>Each library package generates a PDF report containing the
annotated spectra, and a single text file containing all spectra in
NIST MSP format. The PDF report allows the spectra and identification
evidence to be viewed without specialized software. The MSP file can
be used to import the spectra into other software, for example to
create a custom searchable library in the NIST MS Search program. The
PDF reports and MSP files are available below (through links to
Dropbox). MD5 checksums are given to verify the file integrity. 

<p>Within the R packages, the mass spectra (m/z values, intensities,
and fragment ion identifications) and metatdata (compound names,
retention times, compound classes, etc.) are stored in CSV format for
working with the data in R or exporting it to other software. The
packages may contain functions to generate summary tables and plots.

<p>The mass spectral library packages depend on <a href =
start.html>OrgMassSpecR</a> and <a href =
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/png/index.html>png</a>.</p>

<h3>California Sea Lion Contaminant Library (Example)</h3>
<p>This library is provided as proof-of-concept.  It contains a
vignette <a href="OrgMassSpecR-libraries.pdf">(PDF)</a> describing the
general file structure and functionality of spectral library
packages.</p>
