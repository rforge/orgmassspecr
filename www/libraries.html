<p>The spectral library packages are available through
the <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/orgmassspecr/">OrgMassSpecR
R-Forge</a> webpage, under R packages.

<p>Mass spectral libraries are provided as companion packages to
OrgMassSpecR. The library content is currently focused on electron
impact (EI) spectra of anthropogenic environmental contaminants and
halogenated natural products. The libraries are intended to document
and organize the evidence for compound identifications, and thus have
a somewhat different focus than standard reference databases such as
the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist1a.cfm">NIST/EPA/NIH
library</a>. For example, the OrgMassSpecR libraries store fragment
ion identifications obtained by the manual interpretation of mass
spectra and allow organization based on compound class and other
parameters. The libraries may also contain interesting but
unidentified mass spectra.

<p>Each library package generates a PDF report containing the
annotated spectra, and a single text file containing all spectra in
NIST MSP format. The PDF report allows the spectra and identification
evidence to be viewed without specialized software. The MSP file can
be used to import the spectra into other software, for example to
create a custom searchable library in the NIST MS Search program. The
PDF reports and MSP files are available below (through links to
Dropbox). MD5 checksums are given to verify the file integrity. Within
the R packages, the spectra and metatdata are stored in CSV formats
for working with the data in R, and the packages may contain functions
to generate summary tables and plots.

<h3>California Sea Lion Contaminant Library (Example)</h3>
<p>This library is provided as proof-of-concept.  It contains a
vignette <a href="OrgMassSpecR-libraries.pdf">(PDF)</a> describing the
general file structure and functionality of spectral library
packages.</p>
<em>Package Name:</em> SpecLibExample<br>
<em>Authors:</em> Eunha Hoh and Nathan Dodder<br>
<em>Sample:</em> Single sea lion blubber sample from a 4+ year old
male stranded in southern California.<br>
<em>Instrument:</em> GCxGC-TOF in EI mode.<br>
<em>Compounds:</em> 35 anthropogenic contaminants, 3 suspected natural
halogenated products, and 1 unknown.<br>
<em>PDF Report:</em> <a href =
"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6649072/OrgMassSpecR/SpecLibExample.pdf">SpecLibExample.pdf</a>. 595 KB. MD5 checksum: aa07e28848b7bff311d6dcdeeb097fc1<br>
<em>NIST MSP Text Format:</em> <a href =

<h3>Massachusetts Dolphin Blubber Contaminant Library</h3>
<h3> [This section is under construction.] </h3>
<em>Package Name:</b></em> SpecLibDolphin2011<br>
<em>Literature Reference:</em> The original PDF version of this library appears in "A non-targeted GCÃ—GC/TOF-MS method and software for inventorying persistent and bioaccumulative contaminants in marine environments," <cite>Environmental Science and Technology</cite>, in press.<br>
<em>Authors:</em> Eunha Hoh, Nathan G. Dodder, Steven J. Lehotay, Kristin C. Pangallo, Christopher M. Reddy, and Keith A. Maruya <br> 
<em>Sample:</em> Blubber from a common dolphin (<em>Delphinus delphis</em>) fatally stranded January 2006 in Orleans, Massachusetts.<br>
<em>Instrument:</em> GCxGC-TOF in EI mode. A full description of the analytical method is in the above literature reference.<br>
<em>Compounds:</em> The data set contains a total of 271 identified compounds belonging to 24 structural classes. All compounds but one were halogenated. 
Eighty-six compounds were anthropogenic contaminants that are not routinely targeted in environmental surveys, and 54 compounds were halogenated natural products. Spectra for the 55 PCB congeners are not included in the library. The library also contains 27 halogenated mass spectra 
that were not able to be identified.<br>
