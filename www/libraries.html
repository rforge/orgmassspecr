<p>Mass spectral libraries are provided as companion packages to
OrgMassSpecR. The library content is currently focused on electron
impact (EI) spectra of anthropogenic environmental contaminants and
halogenated natural products. The libraries are intended to document
and organize the evidence for compound identifications, and thus have
a somewhat different focus than standard reference databases such as
the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist1a.cfm">NIST/EPA/NIH
library</a>. For example, the OrgMassSpecR libraries store fragment
ion identifications obtained by the manual interpretation of mass
spectra and allow organization based on compound class and other
parameters. The libraries may also contain interesting but
unidentified mass spectra.

<p>Each library package generates a PDF report containing the
annotated spectra, and a single text file containing all spectra in
NIST MSP format. The PDF report allows the spectra and identification
evidence to be viewed without specialized software. The MSP file can
be used to import the spectra into other software, for example to
create a custom searchable library in the NIST MS Search program. The
PDF reports and MSP files are available below (through links to
Dropbox). MD5 checksums are given to verify the file integrity. Within
the R packages, the spectra and metatdata are stored in CSV formats
for working with the data in R, and the packages may contain functions
to generate summary tables and plots.

<p>The packages are available through
the <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/orgmassspecr/">OrgMassSpecR
R-Forge</a> webpage, under R packages.
